        <p>Building on top of positive feedback from the user community on Arvor/Provor floats, the primary recommendations from the workshop are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To improve and facilitate <b>communication</b> within the Argo community on all technical issues (eg: floats failure modes, ongoing sensor and float problems to be solved, recommended standard configurations, etc...). The Arvor/Provor float users could potentially build upon the <a href="http://github.com/euroargodev">Euro-Argo Collaborative Framework</a> and keep organizing recurrent workshops;</li>
            <li>To share <b>pre-deployment procedures</b> among Arvor-Provor users for:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>In house facilities or on dock before departure:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For float configuration (eg: macros defining standard missions, NKE mission design GUI)</li>
                            <li>Post-delivery checklist (eg: Iridium tests, battery tests, sensor tests, etcâ€¦)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                <li>At sea:<br>
                    <ul><li>Deployment checklist (1 page sheet)</li></ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
            <li>The Arvor/Provor user community recommends that sensor manufacturers develop <b>sensor self-testing capabilities</b> that would be incorporated into the already existing auto-testing feature of the Arvor/Provor floats.</li>

            <li>The Arvor/Provor user community recommends <b>float and sensor manufacturers</b> to provide central entry points (and machine-to-machine readable) for:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>best practices</b> checklists for their floats or sensors,</li>
                    <li><b>meta-data</b> access on floats or sensors with as many technical details as possible (eg: about pre-calibration, sub-component information),</li>
                    <li>technical <b>vocabulary</b> definitions in line with those of the Argo data management team</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To continuously develop and improve online fleet <b>monitoring</b> tools like <a href="https://fleetmonitoring.euro-argo.eu">https://fleetmonitoring.euro-argo.eu</a> (eg: to include more information on sensor performance).</li>
            <li>The user community requests that NKE extend the <b>mission planning tool</b> APMT Profiler GUI (dedicated to the Provor CTS5) to the Arvor. This tool allows the user to design a configuration and receive information about the expected lifetime of the float, data telemetry estimates, etc., as a function of sensor payload and cycle configurations.</li>
            <li>To <b>improve recovery methods</b> of floats. This workshop resulted in the creation of a working group on this topic at <a href="github.com/euroargodev/recovery">github.com/euroargodev/recovery</a>.</li>
